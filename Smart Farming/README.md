# Crop Recommendation System

## Overview
This Crop Recommendation System leverages machine learning to provide precise, data-driven recommendations for farmers on which crops to plant based on soil properties and environmental conditions. The system aims to optimize agricultural productivity and sustainability by using predictive analytics.

## Features
- Analyzes soil properties (N, P, K ratios) and environmental factors (temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall).
- Utilizes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights within agricultural data.
- Employs machine learning models (Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, SVM) for accurate crop prediction.
- Offers interactive data visualizations for a better understanding of agricultural conditions.
- Implements K-Means clustering to identify similar groups of crops, aiding in crop rotation and soil management.

## Technologies
